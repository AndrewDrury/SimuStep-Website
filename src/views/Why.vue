                Take a step in the right direction with SimuStep: a
                neuroprosthetic assistive walking device for people affected by
                foot drop

              <h4>What is foot drop?</h4>
              <p>
                Foot drop is a medical condition that impairs an individual's
                ability to lift their foot. This can cause trips/falls and
                development of gait problems. Foot drop is often a permanent
                symptom of a more serious condition, such as ALS, Cerebral
                Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, and many more.
              </p>
              <h4>Why SimuStep?</h4>

                    SimuStep was founded by four Mechatronics Engineering
                    Students at the University of Waterloo to provide support
                    for people with foot drop. Rather than designing another
                    rigid, uncomfortable brace to prevent tripping, the goal of
                    SimuStep is to provide active electrical muscle stimulation
                    to help the patient walk by themselves and help rehabilitate
                    the condition in the process. SimuStep will allow people
                    affected by foot drop to walk on their own again and regain
                    their independence, while prioritizing comfort,
                    discreteness, and rehabilitation. You'll hardly even know
                    its' there!
